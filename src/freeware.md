A new electronic music project started in 2022. The project seeks to experiment with releasing music outside of predatory music streaming services like Spotify in favor of self-hosting and p2p sharing. First released track was a remix of Touch The Sun by Cryalot in August 2022 with original music to come sometime in 2023.
