# technology.

My notes on technology as a hobbyist hacker recently turned professional software engineer.

## start here:

[[my projects]] - Favorite tools I've built and what I learned from building them.

## recently updated others:

[[bike ufo]] - EV-like artificial engine sounds for fixed gear bicycle.

[[vim]] - My cheatsheet for nvim... learning little by little!

[[c programming]] - My favorite programming language and cheatsheet for using pointers.
