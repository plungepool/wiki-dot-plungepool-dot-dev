## General pruning tips

- prune before watering
- cut back twigs so there's only 3-4 nodes
- cut only developed wood
- leave 3-4 leaf pairs when cutting back to develop fine branch structure
- side that leaf closest to cut is on is the side the next branch will develop from
- clip crisscrossing branches
- cut or wire branches going up, save branches going down, manage branches going to sides
- only prune a few times per season, let grow wild until enough new branches develop wood and then prune back, even if certain branches seem like you definitely don't want them

## Chinese Elm

- Repot every two years. (Next repotting: Spring 2024 before growing season)
- Usually the Chinese elm is overwintered as an indoor bonsai. Due to the high temperatures in the room, a elm bonsai consumes a lot of energy in winter.
- To get enough energy (sugar) by photosynthesis before winter, we cut bonsai of the Chinese elm only until mid August.
- After that we let the bonsai tree grow, overwinter it (at about 6-8Â°C or like a Mediterranean bonsai more cool in a unheated plastic tent) and prune it next February, shortly before the new shoots come out.
- Helpful hint: Don't overwinter a bonsai of the Chinese elm too warm. A very bright and very cool location is optimal. Even light frosts are tolerated by this bonsai tree species.
