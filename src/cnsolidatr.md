This was a little tool mostly for my personal use. When I would mix or master an album, I often had to consolidate mixdowns from many project files for clients and sometimes I would forget to update the client folders to the latest mixes, which this tool was meant to help solve. I do things differently when I mix albums now so it's not really needed for me anymore.
