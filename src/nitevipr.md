## **NiteVipr Mach2**

**Prototype Arcade Stick Drum Sampler and Sequencer**

*From the next evolution in joystick-based rhythm sequencing technology comes the NiteVipr Mach2, a self-contained sample-based drum machine based around the ultra-accessible and fast live pattern performance scheme first pioneered with the [MIDIchamp DrumStik 3D](ds3d.md). Save and load samples, sequences, and presets from your microSD card, manipulate using on-board effects, and perform and sequence with tactile high-quality arcade parts in ways never previously possible in a drum machine. **No longer in active development***

- **Platform:** Teensy 4.0 32-bit microcontroller
- **Libraries:** Teensy, Arduino
- **Language:** C++
- **Skills:** Real-time audio interrupts, recording and playing back sequenced data, internal clock, switches and debounce
- **Homepage:** [maybe someday]
