Been working on this virtual instrument on and off the past couple years, planning to release an alpha as part of my [[freeware fyi]] multimedia project soon and refine it over time. I've been teaching myself more audio programming and DSP and this has been an awesome project to implement everything I've been learning from scratch. Written in C using SDL with GCC and CMake toolchain. Eventually would like to port to an embedded platform further down the line for personal use.
