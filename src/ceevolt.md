Scrapped this project as creating the custom profile necessary for iOS or other devices to recognize it as bluetooth MIDI was beyond my ability and understanding. It also just wasn't especially useful, it was more of a learning thing for me to use STM hardware and a bit of DAC and wireless. Still quite satisfying to send midi messages wirelessly and hear the synth react.
