      <h1>chess.</h1>
<p>I used to think chess was super boring. I always saw chess as suffering from "analysis paralysis," which to me is the biggest board game sin there is. The last thing I want to do is stare at a board state for 5 or 10 or 20+ minutes at a time until I am able to make a decision, then wait as my opponent does the same. </p>
<p>Then I got ambushed with a chess clock. I was at a small gathering in March 2022 when my friend whipped out a chess set and set the clock at 5 minutes apiece. That's when I realized that chess can be an amazingly fun and exciting game again when you put a time limit on it, and by playing games that only last 10 or 20 minutes total, you can play more and learn from experience more rapidly. Now I play chess virtually every day and it has become one of my most favorite recent hobbies.</p>
<h2>openings notes.</h2>
<h3>the london system.</h3>
<p>A stable opening for white that sets up a deadly attack if black chooses to castle kingside. The first opening for white that I learned how to play.</p>
<p><img alt="the london system" src="../media/the%20london%20system.png" /></p>
<ol>
<li>Pawn to d4 and bishop to f4.</li>
<li>Push pawns to defend d4 and bf4.</li>
<li>Develop knights and remaining bishop.</li>
<li>Advance knight to attack f7.</li>
<li>Push h pawn to set up kingside attack.</li>
</ol>
<h3>the caro-kann defence.</h3>
<p>A solid, simple opening for black and the first opening for black that I learned.</p>
<ul>
<li>e4 - c6</li>
</ul>
<h3>the king's indian.</h3>
<p>A basic opening that can be played similarly as either white or black.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>As White</strong>: kf3 - g3 - bg2 - O-O - d3</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>As Black</strong> (in defense of d4): d6 - kf6 - g6 - bg7 - O-O</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>barry attack.</h3>
<p>An opening to play against the King's Indian Defence that I learned because one of my friends who is a bit better at chess than me always plays it(it worked and I won).</p>
<ol>
<li>d4 Nf6 </li>
<li>Nf3 g6 </li>
<li>Nc3 d5 </li>
<li>Bf4. </li>
</ol>
<p>Black usually plays 4...Bg7 after which the most popular continuation is </p>
<ol>
<li>e3 0-0 </li>
<li>Be2 </li>
</ol>
<p>however, </p>
<ol>
<li>Qd2</li>
</ol>
<p>the "Tarzan Attack", is also playable. (Use bishop protected by queen to force a trade of the fianchetto black bishop)</p>
<p><strong>four pawns attack.</strong></p>
<p>The Four Pawns Attack in the King's Indian Defence is a chess opening that begins with the moves:</p>
<ol>
<li>d4 Nf6</li>
<li>c4 g6</li>
<li>Nc3 Bg7</li>
<li>e4 d6</li>
<li>f4</li>
</ol>
<p>"White immediately builds up a large pawn centre in order to gain a spatial advantage. Black first develops his pieces, then tries to attack White's centre by means of the pawn advances ...e7–e5, ...c7–c5 or ...f7–f5, depending on circumstances."</p>
<h3>pirc defence.</h3>
<p>An opening for black that is generally considered to not be very good but sometimes played due to its irregularity.</p>
<ul>
<li>Black - defends against e4</li>
<li>d6 - kf6 - g6 - bg7</li>
</ul>
