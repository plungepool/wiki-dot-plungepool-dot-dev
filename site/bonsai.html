<p>This is a collection of notes about each type of bonsai tree I own and guides for care collected from various sources. I have always had an appreciation of bonsai and Japanese gardening, but these became a more serious interest sometime in 2019 and I acquired my first tree in early 2020. I remain a beginner, especially not having any outdoor space to utilize for the hobby until 2022, but I'm excited to grow more now without the limitation. </p>
<p>In 2024 I joined my local bonsai club and am learning at a much more rapid pace than I was before, and now that I've internalized more of the basics I am restructuring this page to include less general information and more notes about my specific trees as I learn them.</p>
<h2>bonsai in training.</h2>
<h3>chinese elm ("elmer")</h3>

<ul>
<li>Acquired in January 2020 from Kimura Bonsai at their former location in Northridge, CA. This was is my first tree which I kept alive indoors under grow lamps in our 1-bedroom apartment until June 2022 when we were able to move to a place with outdoor space. It's much happier to be outdoors now, but I am now in the process of re-training it as I need to develop the trunk more before concerning myself with the branch structure like I was previously trying to.</li>
<li><strong>Styling notes:</strong> Not sure yet! In the process of rethinking its entire design. I love the existing nebari, so I definitely want to keep developing that.</li>
<li><strong>Next repotting - Late Feb 2025 or 2026 before growing season:</strong> Last repotted in 2024, but want to repot again next chance I get in order to re-train it in an oversized wooden box in order to grow the trunk. The nebari is probably the nicest thing about this tree currently as well and putting it into a larger container I can spread the roots and develop it more.</li>
<li><strong>Current soil - Akadama mix:</strong> Akadama is great for developing a fine root system in a smaller pot, however it is relatively expensive so I will have to research or ask a club member for a recommendation on another type of soil mix when I move it to a box.</li>
<li><strong>Sunlight - Full sun:</strong> Chinese elms need a lot of light. Placing somewhere it can be exposed to morning sunlight is better due to its low intensity. Direct afternoon sunlight in summers can cause burns in the leaves.</li>
<li><strong>Growing season:</strong>  Begins sprouting in mid-Feb to early March. Pruning a little before shoots start coming out can help stimulate growth.</li>
<li><strong>Dormant season:</strong> I've read that to store up enough energy before winter, you're supposed to prune the Chinese elm only until mid August. However in my very warm climate, new shoots are forming as late as mid-September, so I feel like later than August is probably ok.</li>
<li><strong>Fertilizing:</strong> Trying out fish and kelp liquid fertilizer once per month during growing season. Sprinkle or spray on leaves for foliage fertilization.</li>
</ul>
<h3>chinese elm (split-trunk)</h3>
<p><img alt="Corkbark 2023-03-23" src="../media/Corkbark%202023-03-23.jpg" /></p>
<p><em>Photo: Mar 2023</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Acquired in January 2023 from Kimura Bonsai (Kashi no Ki-en Garden) in Castaic, CA.</li>
<li><strong>Styling notes:</strong> Want to develop as a split trunk, with a primary main trunk and a secondary trunk going off to the right near the base.</li>
<li><strong>Same care notes as the other chinese elm.</strong> This one I have aggressively chopped since this photo was taken, in an attempt to develop its natural existing split trunk.</li>
</ul>
<h3>japanese beautyberry (<em>callicarpa japonica</em>)</h3>
<p><img alt="Beautyberry 2023-03-23" src="../media/Beautyberry%202023-03-23.jpg" /></p>
<p><em>Photo: Mar 2023</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Acquired in January 2023 from Kimura Bonsai (Kashi no Ki-en Garden) in Castaic, CA. </li>
<li>Need to do more research on this tree, haven't found much solid information on their care. A club member suggested that I try to figure out what trees are closely related to it and try following guidelines for those.</li>
<li><strong>Styling notes:</strong> Beautyberry at maturity is an irregular upright form with graceful arching branches, so I want to emulate that. Grows flowers and purple berries during the summer. </li>
<li><strong>Next repotting - Late Feb 2025 before growing season:</strong> Prune and wire in early Spring.</li>
<li><strong>Current soil - Akadama mix:</strong> This tree I'm not sure I will try and box train like the chinese elms so akadama is fine for now. I also really like how easy and visual it is to identify when the soil needs watering. One of the few pieces of information I've picked up about this tree is that apparently the roots thrive in a cool, moist substrate high in organic matter. </li>
<li><strong>Sunlight - Shade/Partial:</strong> Seems to prefer shade/partial shade. Developed leaf scorch in full sun during July, moved to shade and began growing berries and flowers again almost immediately.</li>
<li><strong>Growing season:</strong>  Begins sprouting in early-mid March if I remember correctly. Need to take note of it more precisely next year.</li>
<li><strong>Dormant season:</strong> I think it went dormant around October last year. Will have to note it more precisely this year.</li>
<li><strong>Fertilizing:</strong> Same as other trees for now.</li>
</ul>

<h3>honeysuckle (<em>lonicera japonica</em>)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Acquired in May 2024 from local bonsai club raffle. </li>
<li><strong>Styling notes:</strong> This one came nicely styled already with a deadwood feature near the base.</li>
<li><strong>Next repotting - Unsure:</strong> Repot in spring or fall, every 2-3 years when roots are reaching out near the bottom of the pot.</li>
<li><strong>Current soil - Unsure:</strong> Soil has organic matter sprinkled on top.</li>
<li><strong>Sunlight - Full sun:</strong> Starting in full sun to see how it does.</li>
<li><strong>Growing season:</strong>  Spring through summer. Blooms mid-late June.</li>
<li><strong>Dormant season:</strong> Evergreen.</li>
<li><strong>Fertilizing:</strong> Same as other trees for now.</li>
</ul>
<h3>pelargonium</h3>
<ul>
<li>Acquired in April 2024 from local bonsai club raffle. </li>
<li><strong>Styling notes:</strong> Came lightly styled in small pot.</li>
<li><strong>Next repotting - Unsure:</strong> Repot young plants during growth spurts, every 2-3 years for mature plants.</li>
<li><strong>Current soil - Unsure:</strong> Soil is gravely and organic.</li>
<li><strong>Sunlight - Full sun:</strong> Starting in full sun to see how it does. Supposedly in the hottest parts of summer it may prefer shade.</li>
<li><strong>Growing season:</strong>  Spring through fall, sometimes into winter.</li>
<li><strong>Dormant season:</strong> None, it's a flowering geranium.</li>
<li><strong>Fertilizing:</strong> Flower fertilizer pellets.</li>
</ul>

<h3>jade</h3>
<ul>
<li>Canvas bag acquired in April 2024 from local bonsai club raffle, forest acquired in May 2024 from local bonsai club raffle.</li>
<li>It's a succulent but can be styled as a bonsai tree, also good to live indoors. Want to try styling part of the one in the bag for indoors. The forest I could chop short and arrange in an oversized wooden box to begin to develop.</li>
</ul>
<h3>jacaranda</h3>
<ul>
<li>Acquired in May 2024 from local bonsai club raffle.</li>
<li>A club member warned me that they don't make good bonsai, but I might try anyway. I think they're beautiful trees to have around either way.</li>
<li>Hottest part of summer got a little intense and leaves closed up, happier when moved to partial shade.</li>
<li>Would be nice to try and get into a large grow box next year</li>
</ul>
<h3>tree mallow cuttings</h3>
<ul>
<li>Acquired in April 2024 from local bonsai club raffle. A member propagated these from cuttings last year.</li>
<li>Seems to like full sun and daily watering.</li>
</ul>
<h3>yellow mallow</h3>
<ul>
<li>Acquired in May 2024 from local bonsai club raffle.</li>
<li>I know nothing about these, I don't know if I care to bonsai them or the tree mallow, but will keep it around and see if it grows on me.</li>

<h4>watering guide for bonsai-sitters:</h4>
<ul>
<li>The bonsai in winter will most likely each need watering every 2-3 days if it hasn't rained. If the soil still seems damp on the second day wait till the 3rd. If it gets hot out (75+ degrees) check to see every day if the soil has dried out faster and water more if needed.</li>
<li>The soil (akadama) turns from a dark brown to a light tan when it is starting to dry out so you can check visually. Soak the soil until it's completely wet and water is running out the bottom of the pot.</li>
<li>In the summer, expect to water every day. If the soil is still damp about an inch deep, you may consider delaying watering for another day or half day. Water in the evening for best retention. Japanese beautyberry may require less watering than elms so watering all trees without checking soil moisture individually is to be avoided.</li>
